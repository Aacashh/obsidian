Principle 2 is *EVERYTHING IS A DRAFT*

Prototypes make it to production, quick sketches become long-term plans, and things you write down to get them out of your head end up in the final, published book.

This is as true for a painting as it is for a YouTube channel.

What you're doing is just a draft, it doesn't have to be perfect, it never will be, even after it's done.

Some of the biggest community projects in the world started off with just an idea and a draft.
