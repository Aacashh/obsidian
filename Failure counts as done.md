Failure is good. if you don't try you can't fail It took me a long time to realise this. But failure shows you tried. And you know what NOT to do next time.

An entrepreneur who succeeds with their first company has learned NOTHING.

Someone who fails a few times, has had much better lessons.

notes:

And no-one knows what they're doing. Especially those who haven't failed.

Bo Burnham here understands this, success teaching us nothing.
