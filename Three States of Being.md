1. Not Knowing
    
2. Action
    
3. Completion
    
4. Not Knowing is the initial stage where you are unaware or lack knowledge about something. It could be a problem, a task, a skill, or any situation. This stage is characterized by ignorance, uncertainty, and curiosity.
    
5. the next phase is action. This is where you learn, explore, work, or take steps to change your state of not knowing. It involves effort, struggle, practice, and nearly always, mistakes.
    
6. Completion is the final stage where the task or process is finished or the problem is solved. The state of not knowing has been transformed into knowledge or skill through your action.
    

These three states are cyclical and continuous: after completion, you have a better understanding of the problem, and you very likely have ideas about how to do it again better next time.
