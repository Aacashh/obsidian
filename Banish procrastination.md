You don't necessarily have to throw it away, but you DO have to try something else.

When creativity strikes, it flows out of your fingers into your keys, or your paintbrush, or your guitar.

But sometimes the muses don't sing.

If you write a song a week for a whole year, like my hero Jonathan Coulton here did in 2005, you can't procrastinate!

If the end of the week comes without a good finished song, you have to abandon the idea that didn't work, and try the next one.

Ideas in your brain are like a pipe, full of random stuff. Some of it will be good, some not so good.

If you're not feeling it, don't try to make a bad idea better, try the NEXT idea.
