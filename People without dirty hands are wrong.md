Life is full of small-minded people with narrow horizons. And they're all trying to kill you. They'll kill you with words like "be reasonable", "play it safe", and the worst, "stay in your lane".

You don't have to listen to these people, you don't have to listen to anyone.

I recommend listening to the people who are building the things you love, painting the paintings you love, and writing the music or stories you love.

A small detour, if you will permit me:

Martha Graham

notes:

Martha Graham was an American modern dancer and choreographer. Her style reshaped American dance and is still taught worldwide, and she has advice for us that I will read verbatim:

> There is a vitality, Martha says, a life force, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and there is only one of you in all time, this expression is unique, and if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium; and be lost. The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is, not how it compares with other expression. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel open. You do not even have to believe in yourself or your work. You have to keep open and aware directly to the urges that motivate you. Keep the channel open. No artist is pleased. There is no satisfaction whatever at any time. There is only a queer, divine dissatisfaction, a blessed unrest that keeps us marching and makes us more alive than the others.

I think Martha would have approved of the Cult of Done, don't you?
