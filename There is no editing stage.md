Painting has no editing, if you make a mistake YOU START AGAIN. Performing music has no editing, if you make a mistake you keep going and hope the audience didn't notice. And Pottery has no editing, if it comes out of the kiln and you don't like it, smash it to pieces and start again.

I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965.

â€” Tony Hoare

notes: This principle models the way the world actually works. When you release something into the world, be it a book or a program language, you've lost control of it, in a very big way.

Learn to accept this. Don't tweak what you've got, make another one.
