Spectroscopic Angstrom 

Energy of a level is given by:

$$ E = -\frac{{13.6 eV}}{{n^2}}
$$


- Therefore the change in energy with respect to $n_{i}$ is given by:

$$ \Delta E = E_f - E_i = -\frac{{13.6 eV}}{{n_f^2}} - \left(-\frac{{13.6 eV}}{{n_i^2}}\right)
$$

$$ \Delta E = \frac{{13.6 eV}}{{n_i^2}} - \frac{{13.6 eV}}{{n_f^2}}
$$
- In terms of fundamental constants:

$$ E = -\frac{{m_e e^4}}{{8 \epsilon_0^2 h^2}} \frac{{1}}{{n^2}}
$$ 
$$ \Delta E = E_f - E_i = -\frac{{m_e e^4}}{{8 \epsilon_0^2 h^2}} \left(\frac{{1}}{{n_f^2}} - \frac{{1}}{{n_i^2}}\right)
$$


Therefore, when relating it to the absorbed wavelength we get:

$$ E_{photon} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
$$ $$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left(\frac{{1}}{{n_f^2}} - \frac{{1}}{{n_i^2}}\right)
$$

Therefore the Rh of hydrogen would be:

$$ R_H = \frac{{m_e e^4}}{{8 \epsilon_0^2 h^3 c}}
$$

Hence,

$$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left(\frac{{1}}{{2^2}} - \frac{{1}}{{n_i^2}}\right)
$$

$$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = 1.0967 * 10^{7}m^{-1} $$


### Limitations of Bohr's Theory

- In 1887 we saw that there are two very close lines instead of one (explaination??)
- **1896 P. Zeeman Effect**, they were observing three lines, For $B \propto \delta$  (they saw 3 lines)
- **1939**
