The muses send some ideas to the wrong mind, I think. Or the right mind, but with the wrong experience, or skills, or tools.

That idea isn't yours to hide if you can't build it. Send it out into the world in a post, or a video, and you're done. You've done your part this time round.

Don't hold on it, imagining you'll do it. Be honest with yourself, and let others build it for you!

Ideas are worthless, give them away.
