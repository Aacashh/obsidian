This is the age-old advice to "fake it till you make it". I completely agree, this is how I do all my projects, and you should too!

You're watching me learn how to be a YouTuber in real time. You're watching me learn Rust in real time, learn how to write stories for my audio fiction podcasts in real time, and to learn how to edit and write music for them all, in real time.

I'm learning that maybe sponsors don't really work for me. My channel is possible thanks to viewers like you.
